This is the simple and basic implementation of library management system in C.
It is the first programming project implemented by me and my team members.
It involves the usage of structures, arrays and switch cases for implementing the program.

Just copy the code from "code.c" and paste it in your respective editor and hit "run" button to get the visualized 
output.
